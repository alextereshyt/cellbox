### Cellular War

**Overview**
Cellular War is a procedurally generated cellular automaton game that simulates the rise and fall of civilizations on a map resembling the real world. The game is designed to run autonomously, with civilizations interacting and competing for resources.

**Core Mechanics**
* **Procedural World Generation:** The game map is generated algorithmically, creating realistic terrain features and resource distributions.
* **Cellular Automata:** The game world is divided into a grid of cells, each representing a small area of land. The state of each cell changes over time based on rules that govern population growth, resource consumption, and conflict.
* **Civilizations:** Civilizations emerge from groups of cells that share common cultural and technological traits. They expand, contract, and engage in warfare as they compete for resources and territory.
* **Warfare:** Civilizations can declare war on each other, leading to battles that can result in territorial gains or losses.
* **Technology:** Civilizations can research new technologies, which can provide them with advantages in warfare, resource extraction, and other areas.

**Game Rules**
1. **Population Growth:** The population of each cell increases over time, but is limited by factors such as resource availability and environmental conditions.
2. **Resource Consumption:** Civilizations consume resources such as food, water, and minerals. If a civilization does not have access to sufficient resources, its population will decline.
3. **Territory Expansion:** Civilizations can expand their territory by colonizing unoccupied cells or by conquering cells belonging to other civilizations.
4. **Warfare:** Warfare occurs when two civilizations come into conflict over resources or territory. The outcome of a war is determined by a number of factors, including the size of the armies involved, the technological level of the civilizations, and the terrain of the battlefield.
5. **Technology Research:** Civilizations can research new technologies, which can provide them with advantages in warfare, resource extraction, and other areas.
